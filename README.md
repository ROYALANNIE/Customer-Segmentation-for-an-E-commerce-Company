# Customer Segmentation for an E-commerce Company

## Overview
This project focuses on segmenting customers of an e-commerce platform based on their demographics and purchasing behavior. The goal is to identify distinct customer groups to enable targeted marketing strategies and improve business outcomes.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [Mall Customer Segmentation Data](https://www.kaggle.com/vjchoudhary7/customer-segmentation-tutorial-in-python), which contains information about 200 customers, including:
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)

## Methodology
1. **Data Exploration and Cleaning**: The dataset was inspected for missing values and inconsistencies.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Relevant features were selected and standardized.
3. **Clustering**: K-Means clustering was used to segment customers into 5 distinct groups.
4. **Analysis and Visualization**: Clusters were analyzed and visualized using scatter plots, bar plots, and pair plots.

## Results
Customers were segmented into 5 clusters based on their age, income, and spending behavior. Key insights include:
- **Cluster 0**: Young, low-income, high-spending customers.
- **Cluster 2**: Young, high-income, high-spending customers.
- **Cluster 3**: Middle-aged, high-income, low-spending customers.

## Insights and Recommendations
Actionable recommendations were provided for each cluster, such as targeting high-spending customers with premium products and offering discounts to low-spending customers.
